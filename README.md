# Srengenge Surf Camp - Modernized with Astro

This project has been modernized from a legacy HTML/CSS/JS site to a component-based Astro project.

## Project Structure

- **src/components/**: UI components (Header, Hero, About, etc.)
- **src/layouts/**: Global layout (Layout.astro)
- **src/pages/**: Entry points (index.astro)
- **src/styles/**: Global styles (migrated from styles.css)
- **public/img/**: Static assets
- **legacy_backup/**: Original files (index.html, etc.) for reference.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Build for Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

## Modernization Features

- **Component Architecture**: Code broken down into manageable chunks.
- **Astro Optimization**: Built-in performance handling for scripts and styles.
- **Swiper & AOS Integration**: Modern npm package integration instead of CDN links.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Preserved and verified.
